# MatCare - Maternal & Fetal Health Platform

## Overview

MatCare is a comprehensive maternal and fetal health prediction platform built with Streamlit. The application provides healthcare professionals and expectant mothers with AI-powered risk assessment tools for pregnancy-related health monitoring. The platform features two main prediction models: pregnancy risk assessment and fetal health evaluation, both designed to provide early warning indicators and support informed medical decision-making.

The application combines machine learning models with an intuitive web interface to deliver real-time health predictions based on key maternal health indicators including age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, body temperature, and heart rate.

## User Preferences

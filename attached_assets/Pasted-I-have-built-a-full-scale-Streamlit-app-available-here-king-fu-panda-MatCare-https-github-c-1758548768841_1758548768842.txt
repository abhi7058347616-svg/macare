I have built a full-scale Streamlit app available here:
üëâ [king-fu-panda/MatCare](https://github.com/king-fu-panda/MatCare)

I want you to **improve the UI/UX** and **fix result-related issues** with the following instructions.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The final app must **run smoothly on localhost** with `streamlit run app.py` without errors or glitches.

---

### üîπ UI/UX Enhancements

1. Keep the overall design **simple, minimal, and clean**.
2. Use **modern Streamlit components** (cards, expanders, tabs) where suitable.
3. Fix **alignment issues** and make sure all sections are responsive (desktop & mobile).
4. Replace any confusing layouts with a **clear step-by-step flow** for:

   * Inputting user data
   * Getting predictions (Pregnancy Risk + Fetal Risk Evaluator)
   * Viewing results
5. Add a **consistent header/navigation bar** instead of sidebar-based navigation.

### üîπ Result Display Fixes

1. When showing results for **Pregnancy Risk** and **Fetal Risk Evaluator**:

   * Ensure outputs are **clearly formatted** with headings, risk level, and any numerical scores.
   * Fix any UI glitches when results load (smooth display, no overlaps).
   * Both models‚Äô outputs must look consistent.

2. Add a **Download PDF** button:

   * The PDF must include all relevant details:

     * Patient information (inputs provided)
     * Predictions (Pregnancy risk + Fetal risk)
     * Date/time of generation
     * Project/App name (**MatCare**)
   * Use a reliable library like `reportlab` or `fpdf`.
   * The PDF must download properly and open without formatting issues.

### üîπ Code Instructions

* Keep the **business logic & prediction functions** as they are.
* Only improve **UI/UX** and **result PDF generation**.
* Update `requirements.txt` if new libraries are required.
* Ensure the final app **runs smoothly on localhost** with:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

‚úÖ Deliverables:

* A **cleaner, bug-free UI**.
* Correct and **well-formatted result display**.
* A **working PDF download feature** with complete details.
* Fully tested to work on **localhost without errors**.
